    <h4>Preface</h4>

      <p>
        My first thought of writing out this little book of brief selections
        sprang from the desire to assist a dear friend to enjoy the Author's
        helpful books. "The epigrammatic style lends itself to quotation. Taste
        of the spring brings the traveller back to the same fountain on a day of
        greater leisure. Many times these "Beautiful Thoughts" have enlightened
        my darkness, and I send them forth with a hope and prayer that they may
        find echo in other hearts.

        Some students save money by buying used copies of textbooks, which tend
        to be less expensive, and are available from many college bookstores in
        the US, who buy them back from students at the end of a term. Books that
        are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus
        wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other
        bookstores. Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging
        teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's
        website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code in the book
        to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access
        the website and complete assigned homework.

        While publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook
        pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of
        textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new
        products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers,
        retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials,
        they have expressed concern that the publishers’ practice of packaging
        supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity
        students have to purchase less expensive used books....If publishers
        continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the
        cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the
        future.
